        <h2>Gas and Oil Prediction Model</h2>
        <p>
            I collaborated with a team to design and implement a machine learning model aimed at predicting customer spending behaviors by analyzing user data alongside local weather conditions. 
            Throughout this project, I managed large datasets, ensuring their efficient handling and integrity. 
            I also honed my skills in training machine learning models to achieve accurate predictions. 
            Additionally, I deployed and maintained scripts on Azure, optimizing both performance and scalability to handle the project's demands.
